1. Addressing the Context Window Limitation 

The core technical challenge is that our extensive ASCII documentation is far too large to be included in a single API call to any LLM. Most models have a context window (the amount of text they can process at once) ranging from 8k to 200k tokens, and a full documentation set would easily exceed this. 

Attempting to truncate the documentation would lead to the AI missing critical context, resulting in inaccurate and unreliable reviews. 

Recommended Solution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 

RAG is the industry-standard architecture for solving this exact problem. Instead of giving the LLM the entire documentation, we give it only the most relevant snippets. This is achieved in two phases: 
Phase 1: Preprocessing (One-time Setup) 

     Chunking: The entire ASCII documentation is broken down into smaller, logical, and manageable chunks (e.g., by section, by component, or by a fixed number of paragraphs).
     Embedding: Each chunk is passed through an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small), which converts the text into a numerical vector. This vector represents the semantic meaning of the chunk.
     Indexing: These vectors are stored and indexed in a specialized Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB). This database allows for highly efficient semantic searches.
     

Phase 2: Runtime (During a PR) 

     Analyze PR Diff: The GitHub Action fetches the diff for the pull request.
     Create Query: The script analyzes the diff to identify the changed files and functions (e.g., auth-service.js, database-connector.py). It then formulates a natural language query like, "What documentation exists for the auth service and database connector?"
     Retrieve Relevant Chunks: This query is converted into a vector and used to search the Vector Database. The database returns the top 3-5 most semantically similar documentation chunks.
     Augment Prompt: The GitHub Action then constructs a final, detailed prompt for the LLM that includes:
         The original instructions.
         The PR diff.
         The highly relevant documentation chunks retrieved from the database.
         
     

The LLM now has focused, targeted context and can generate a highly accurate and relevant suggestion without ever needing to see the entire documentation set. 
2. Recommended Approach and LLM Selection 

After evaluating all options, the choice comes down to balancing flexibility, security, and ease of implementation. 

| Approach | Flexibility for RAG | Data Security | Ease of Setup | Structured Output Reliability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Option 1: Direct API (Azure)** | **Excellent** | Excellent | Good | **Excellent (Guaranteed)** |
| **Option 3: GitHub Models** | **Excellent** | Excellent | **Excellent (Easiest)** | Good (Needs Validation) |
| **Option 4: Self-Hosted** | **Excellent** | **Best (On-Prem)** | Poor (Complex) | Fair (Less Reliable) |



Primary Recommendation: Option 3 (GitHub Models) 

This approach provides the best overall balance for your use case. 

     

    Why it's the best fit: It offers the powerful AI capabilities needed for the task while drastically simplifying the setup and maintenance. By using the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN, you eliminate the need to manage third-party API keys, which enhances security and reduces administrative overhead. The workflow remains a native part of the GitHub ecosystem, which is ideal for automation. 
     

    The Critical Caveat: The success of this approach hinges on one key factor: the reliability of the structured output (JSON mode) via the GitHub Models API. Before committing, you must create a proof-of-concept to test if the github/models-inference@v1 action can reliably enforce a JSON schema with GPT-4o. 
     

Secondary Recommendation (Fallback): Option 1 (Direct API to Azure OpenAI) 

If your testing reveals that GitHub Models' structured output is not robust enough for a fully automated pipeline, this is the guaranteed-to-work alternative. 

     Why it's the best fallback: Azure OpenAI provides direct, unfettered access to the GPT-4o API with its native, highly reliable JSON mode. This ensures the AI's output will always conform to the required schema, preventing your automation from breaking. It offers the same excellent data security guarantees as GitHub Models, with the only downside being the added complexity of managing API keys.
     

3. Final Conclusion and LLM Justification 
The Best Approach 

For this project, the recommended approach is Option 3: Using GitHub Models (Built-in LLM API), with Option 1: Direct API Calls to Azure OpenAI as a robust fallback plan. This strategy allows you to pursue the simplest and most integrated solution first, while having a proven, more controllable alternative ready if needed. 
The Best LLM: GPT-4o 

For the specific task of analyzing code and generating a structured proposal, GPT-4o is the most suitable LLM. 

Justification and Comparison: 

| Feature | **GPT-4o (Winner)** | Claude 3 Opus | Llama 3 70B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code Analysis** | Excellent. State-of-the-art understanding of code structure and intent. | Excellent. On par with GPT-4o, often praised for nuanced reasoning. | Very Good. Competes well but may lag on highly complex or novel code. |
| **Structured Output** | **Best-in-class.** Its native JSON mode is the most reliable and easiest to implement, which is **critical for automation**. | Very Good. Can reliably produce JSON, but GPT-4o's implementation is slightly more robust and widely adopted. | Fair. Can be prompted for JSON, but requires more careful prompt engineering and is less guaranteed, making it risky for automation. |
| **Context Window** | Large (128k tokens). More than sufficient for the diff + retrieved RAG chunks. | Massive (200k tokens). The largest available, but the advantage is marginal for this specific RAG use case. | Large (128k tokens). Sufficient for the task. |
| **Data Security** | Excellent. Available via both GitHub Models and Azure OpenAI, both of which have strong data privacy policies. | Excellent. Anthropic has a strong zero data retention policy. | Best (if self-hosted), but data is sent to a third-party if using a managed API. |


Conclusion: While Claude 3 Opus is a formidable competitor, GPT-4o's superior and more reliable structured output capability makes it the definitive choice for this project. The requirement to generate a machine-readable JSON proposal to automatically create a GitHub issue is a hard constraint. GPT-4o excels at this, reducing the risk of parsing errors and ensuring the workflow's stability.
